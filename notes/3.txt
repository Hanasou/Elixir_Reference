Structs
- Find the struct definition inside Identicon.Image
- We initialize a struct like this
%ModuleName{FieldName: FieldValue}

More Pattern Matching stuff for Structs
%Identicon.Image{hex: [r, g, b | _tail]} = image
- To review, what we're basically doing here is initializing seperate r, g, and b variables based on what's inside of the hex field
- | _tail means that we're basically tossing away the rest of the values in hex

def get_rgb_refactored(%Identicon.Image{hex: [r, g, b | _tail]} = image)
- We can pattern match these values as we're passing them into a function as well

Reminder of the pipe operator, we're passing the value on the top of this as an argument into all the functions below it
- So hex gets passed as the first argument into Enum.chunk_every(3) and mirror_row()
hex     
|> Enum.chunk_every(3) 
|> mirror_row()
