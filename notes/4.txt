Phoenix
- mix phx.new <project name> is how we generate a new phoenix project
- Oh, make sure you have Phoenix actually installed
- While inside the root directory of our Phoenix app (in this case, "discuss"), run mix ecto.create to set up the database
- In order to set that up, you need an instance of Postgres running
- Run mix phx.server to start the server

- Phoenix is a full MVC framework. It has all sorts of things that you would expect from one.
- Elixir comes with its own html templating that you'll see in the .heex files

Layout
- In the layout directory you'll see a bunch of heex files that includes the UI for the application
- root.html.heex contains the header for all our pages.
