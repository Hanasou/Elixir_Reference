Create a new project with Mix
mix new <project_name>

Modules and Functions
- Use "defmodule" to declare a module. Most all of our code will be grouped into a module
- Use "def" to declare a function.
- It appears that both of these constructs have a "do" at the beginning, and "end" at the end.
- So a function will look something like...
def func do
    "hello world"
end
- Elixir has implicit return, kind of like Scala, where the last line is what we return

Running our program
Type in...
iex -S mix
- This opens up a REPL to type Elixir code in. This also compiles our project so we're able to run it in here.
- So to run what we want, we write Module.function()
